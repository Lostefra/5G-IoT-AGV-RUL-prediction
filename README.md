# 5G IoT AGV's training code for Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
This repository contains the dataset used in the paper "Data-Driven 5G-Enabled Remaining Useful Life Estimation for Industrial IoT: a Holistic Approach".

Detailed discussion about models and their hyper-parameters is available here: [deep_learning_models_analysis.pdf](https://github.com/Lostefra/5G-IoT-AGV-RUL-prediction/blob/main/deep_learning_models_analysis.pdf).

The results provided in the paper are also available [here](https://github.com/Lostefra/5G-IoT-AGV-RUL-prediction/blob/main/testing_summary_5.csv) and [here](https://github.com/Lostefra/5G_IoT_AGV_RUL_prediction/blob/main/testing_summary_10.csv).
